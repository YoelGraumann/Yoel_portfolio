      <description>In this project I will perform intent classification using three different models to see which one is better for this task. I will be using PyTorch. the data I used for this notebook is provided on github . The names are testlabel, testseq.in, train_label, trainseq.in
The steps in this project were:
Uploading the data and understanding it
Preprocessing the data and some feature engineering
Creating my own tokenization algorithm
Creating my own accuracy, confusion matrix and training functions</description>

      <description>This is a project I did on the &amp;ldquo;Shock Dataset&amp;rdquo; which was provided during my Generalized Linear Models course. This projects includes my R output and My Statistical inference / analysis. I&amp;rsquo;m proud to say that I got the maximum grade on this course.
This project includes:
 A description of the Data Preliminary &amp;amp; exploratory analysis  Distribution exploration Correlation Matrix boxplots   Formulation of the GLIM Model fitting, Diagnostics &amp;amp; Outlier Detection  Here&amp;rsquo;s a Preview image:</description>

      <description>This is a project I did with Dekel Karp and Dylan Vialla during my BSc at HUJI .This project was done on a purely Categorical Data set using the &amp;ldquo;Insight&amp;rdquo; software which was created by Prof. Zvi Gilula from HUJI&amp;rsquo;s Statistics &amp;amp; Data Science department. Prof. Zvi Gilula has created this software using R. The output provided is from the &amp;ldquo;insight&amp;rdquo; software. This was a very complicated project, especially because of the P_Values.</description>

      <title>Project 3: Amazon Customer Review Data</title>
      <link>https://yoelgraumann.github.io/Yoel_portfolio/post/project3/</link>

      <description>This is a project I did on the Amazon Customer Review Data. The Dataset was downloaded from the Amazon Web Service using the boto3 library. I made this project in Python using google colab.
This project includes:
 Downloading the Data from the Amazon Web Service using boto3. Preprocessing and Feature engineering. Including processing the amazon reviews themselves using basic NLP libraries and functions fitting classification models and trying to improve them by:  creating an &amp;ldquo;averaged&amp;rdquo; combined model of Logistic Regressions Creating a voting system with multiple classifiers   Using Mini-batches and The Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm to learn data when our memory is finite, such as in google colab.</description>

      <description>In this Project I used the israeli 2021 elections data and the israeli socio-economic data to try and profile the voters of each party based on their socio-economic background, using PCA.
Since I&amp;rsquo;m also practicing my TensorFlow and Keras deep learning skills, I tried to create a multi layer perceptron model which tried to predict a city&amp;rsquo;s socio-economic background based on the votes each party got in the said city.</description>
